## Intro

A lot of people who are new to Requiem don't know what to do in the early game to gain levels, and even experienced users who want to play Dead is Dead might power-game a bit more before venturing forth. Here is a primer to help survive the first 10-15 levels without even entering dangerous combat.

> This guide uses more cheese tactics than a McDonald's uses in a month!

Character created must have Lock-picking and Smithing perks |(and selected them as starting talents) to make best use of this guide. First perks from level ups if not chosen at character create should be allocated into Speechcraft, then optionally Alchemy. If you don't plan on taking alchemy, then you can still sell any herbs you forage.

At all points in the guide players should
1. Loot every herb you come across
1. Kill and loot every bunny, fox and deer you can catch.
1. Lockpick any locked doors (if your a thief) / display chests (always). If you not a thief you can knock on the door and ask to be let in for speechcraft XP.
1. Take a bath before selling anything, you get gold and speechcraft penalties if you are dirty.
1. Collect any vegetables which are not marked steal, Loot all chicken/bird nests(which are not marked steal) and activate the cows for milk.
1. Loot every chest/barrel/crate not marked steal
1. Forage whenever near wooden stumps / Fallen trees with Mushrooms.
1. Whenever you complete a quest for someone, you can usually take low value items from their home or store without being a thief.
1. Whenever you are in a town, locate and train with the training dummies for a hour or two, or study one of the skill books.
1. Mine any Ore nodes you come ac cross.
1. Sell things to appropriate vendors, Potions/Reagents to alchemists, Weapons/Armor to blacksmiths, Magical items and Clothing to wizards, Meat to Innkeepers, General goods stores should be last resort for clutter you cant sell anywhere else.
1. Fish at every fishing supplies - or equip the rod and attach the water to fish. Fish until you consistently pick up junk.
1. The inspired buff from campfires gives you 5% Skill gain buff for 6 hours - therefore whenever crafting, training or fighting you should gave this buff on you. It should be something you create whenever the buff expires.


You should choose either Falkreath (less chance of dying from exposure, but can encounter bandits and wildlife on the way) or Helgen Border start (Colder and a risk of exposure death in spawn into a snowstorm, but has a easy to access chest with good loot and with less chance of running into wildlife).
 
Make sure you allocate your perks before leaving and set up you weapon favorites.

If starting at Falkreath Border - then make your way to Helgan, avoid fighting the bandits as they generally have bows.

if starting at Helgen Border - do not enter the abandoned outpost, at the bottom of the first hill where the path veers off the the left, Follow the markers to the top of the hill, then carefully walk down the hill on the other side, there is a chest to your right near the edge of the mountain. Next to the chest is a skeleton which a iron war-axe to loot (useful for chopping trees). The chest normally contains some expensive goodies. If you exposure meter gets too high - use the axe on trees to build a campfire.

Carefully follow the paved road and make your way to Helgan.

## Helgen

I recommend looting Helgen first before doing anything else - 3 days after game starts it fills with bandits. 

Head first to the big burning inn type structure as lots of tankards and iron items you can break down for fragments. You can use the fallen tree to access the upper level which has more items / mead bottles. 

After that, if you are capable of picking the locks, and have lockpicks - into the fort proper. Use the left hand door to the barracks area.

> * Once inside, Loot everything. There is a full set of heavy or light armor with all required weapons. 
> * Open all of the chests and barrels - literally strip the place - don't worry about your carry weight if you have smithing, we can address that once we arrive in the kitchen. 
> * Use the pull cords to open the gates into the main part of the fort.
> * Collect the wood by the fireplace and craft yourself a chest (Requires Smithing & Survivalist toolkit) - this will make carrying you loot a lot easier. Place it in the room and start filling it with all the loot you are going to sell or use to level smithing later. Store any spare wood you get as you will need this to construct a campfire later.
> * Make sure you pick up everything in this room as well - all goes into your chest.
> * There is a crossbow/bolts located on the barrels. One of the barrels is full of vital potions - make sure you check and collect everything.
> * If you didn't pick smithing, Do not forget the Craftsman Manual. You should be perking the first selection in Smithing as soon as you can. Even if you're a magic user, this will help you gain levels safely.
> * Continue though the fort picking up everything (The crushing devices in the dungeons can be left as these don't have a sell value and cannot be broken down). Make sure you check every chest, shelf, bag and body in the area.
> * Pick open every locked jail door you see for experience. Once you get to the underground stream, turn around and go back though the keep - the only thing further is a dozen frostbite spiders and certain death. Don't forget to pick up your chest before leaving.

If it's dark when you exit, you can use the bed in the burning inn to sleep in - it's a lot safer to make the Riverwood run in daylight, however if you do so - Anise's cabin will be steal rather than take. Walk from Helgan to Riverwood killing & looting any critters Rabbits/foxes you spot on the way - stick to the roads and avoid the bandit camp. At the guardian stones - loot the alchemy bag, walk down to the hunters and pick up the free fishing rod. Check the hunter's stocks on the shore of the river near the ferry, they sometimes have beef. 

If you are feeling brave, you can take a detour to the the unmarked shrine of Talos, there is at least 2 free Amulets of Talos on the worshippers, Elven Sword, Elven Dagger, and random enchanted item. Again - Loot everything.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26418143/163391300-aea2c046-41ac-4e63-a5dd-5509bfbcb9a8.png)

Cross the river and go to Anise's Cabin and take everything not nailed down, Read the Alchemy book in on a table at the foot of the bed for free experience (if your a thief - steal it so you can study later) - Anise won't aggro unless you go into her locked cellar, but provided she is outside, other than the book, everything else inside her cabin is free to loot (including her veggie patch outside). If you arrive before midnight on the first day. You can either walk down to Riverwood looting herbs on Anise's side of the river and cross at the lumber mill (checking inside of tree-stumps as some contain loot), or cross back over the river - should you encounter Wolves, hope you can run to Riverwood and let the guards take care of them (more dangerous but will give you wolf meat, reagents and pelts). 

Once you arrive at Riverwood go to the campsite outside of the town and place your chest, empty it with the exception to your alchemy stocks and the enchanted clothing items. Break down wooden items (bowls ect) into kindling and start a campfire - upgrade it to maximum and stand near until you get the inspired buff.

Speak to Alvor,if you didn't invest into Smithing in character create, you will need to purchase the smithing toolkit from him.

Run around Riverwood looting any vegetables or chicken nests which aren't marked as steal, click the cows for their milk. Empty and fill water bottles at the river. Then use the cooking pot & chefs toolkit to craft any stews you can make. Surplus ingredients go in your chest.  Make sure you run down to the bridge and pick up the free Salmon.

Keep a bow and some arrows or the crossbow & bolts if you are a physical fighter(it's safer to attack the giant the companions are fighting from range and will give you marksman experience. For mages - be aware of friendly fire and try to range attack the giant). Break everything metal/hide/leather down and re-smelt into ingots. Make sure you craft some more lockpicks with your broken down materials, you will need them in Dragonreach. Also recommend crafting a Alchemist and Chef's toolkit, anything additional you can use to temper your weapons. You can use the wood chopping blocks at the lumber mill to get yourself some more wood and craft yourself some arrows or bolts if you are a archer. With any extra ingots/leather continue to craft, smelt, breakdown until you run out of material. The unenchanted clothing can be broken down and converted to bandages at the forge, while any healing alchemy reagent (e.g Blue mountain flowers) can be made into medical paste. Both these items should be combined to give you healing poultices (I suggest carrying 1-3 at all times unless you are perked into restoration). By this point you should have leveled up at least once, so make sure to invest that point into Speechcraft (and alchemy if you have two perks available)

The enchanted clothing you obtained should be kept and sold to Farengar once you arrive in Whiterun (if you don't intend on wearing it yourself). Hold on to your alchemy supplies - Arcadia has better prices than the Riverwood alchemist. Anything else you are carrying which can't be broken down should be sold to the Riverwood trader. Finally pick up your chest.

Leave Riverwood and head to Whiterun, again picking up herbs & free vegetables from the farm on the way - be careful at the river - there is 4 mudcrabs and two wolves in the area if they start to fight stand on the large rock and be prepared to ranged shoot the survivors. Once again looting/clean/skin any corpses.  Note: If you are a thief, you can avoid this altogether, and steal a low value item - like some wood from one of the woodpiles in Riverwood and immediately offer to pay your fine to the guard which will teleport you to Dragonreach. 

Once past the fights, pick any herbs or skill a skin critters until you arrive at the Whiterun farms. Use ranged attacks to help out the companions with their giant problem. You can generally loot some or all of the crops/barrels in this area. Once you make it to Whiterun proper - check the chests and barrels outside the gates - they normally contain items which can be broken down, food or items which can be sold.  

## Whiterun

<details>
  <summary>Spoiler warning: Outlaw Refuge location</summary>
  <blockquote>
  Located at the rear of the Bannered mare, inside of the animal pens. Manhole in the centre pen.
  </blockquote>
</details>

As soon as you arrive, speak with Adrienne and get the quest to deliver a sword to Proventus Avenicci in Dragonsreach.

If you are tired, there is a free bed in the outlaw's refuge (every city has one). Make sure you pick up any herbs around town, Loot all chicken nests and activate the cows for milk. You should do this at every city you visit. Wooden chests can be placed within sewers for easy access to your stashed stocks while in town.

You can read the skill books in the city. The books are located in the following areas - Grab them as you see them:

> * An Archery book (Black Arrow, The, Part II) on the top shelf behind the counter of the Drunken Huntsman.
> * An Alchemy book (Herbalist's Guide to Skyrim) on a table through a door to the left of the alchemy lab in Arcadia's Cauldron.
> * A Speech book (Biography of the Wolf Queen) on the cupboard opposite the entrance at Belethor's General Goods.
> * An Archery book in Honningbrew Meadery bookshelf to the left when entering (Also in House Clan Battle-Born or House Gray-Mane or in the Temple of Kynareth).
> * A Restoration book (Withershins) on a bookshelf in the Temple of Kynareth.
> * A Two-Handed book (Battle of Sancre Tor) in the House of Clan Battleborn.

> * A Two-handed book (Song of Hrormir) in Kodlak Whiteman's room in the Jorrvaskr Living Quarters.
> * A Archery book(The Marksmanship Lesson) in a expert locked display cabinet in Aela's Quarters. This book is also available at Mixwater mill in Windhelm if you cannot pick the lock.
> * A Smithing book (Armorer's Challenge, The) on the shelf next to the Skyforge .
> * An Illusion book (Before the Ages of Man) sitting on a table in the Jarl's quarters of Dragonsreach.
> * A Enchanting book(Enchanter's Primer) Carlotta Valentia's House, on the bedroom floor

Deliver the sword to Proventus Avenicci. Once delivered, you can take everything not marked as steal in Dragonsreach (Specifically the great porch and Jarl's quarters have the most free items provided they are not occupied). Breakdown all silver and iron and steel you find for easier carry. Lockpick locked chests and display cases. Doing this quest also gives you a free bed in Dragonsreach. You can take a mammoth tusk in the Jarl's quarters storage room and give it to Ysolda to get free speech experience. If you don't plan on joining the companions you can use the dummies at the great porch to train a few hours for safe experience.

At Farengar, get the quest to deliver frost salts to Arcadia. Sell him the enchanted robes you collected from Helgan.

If you join the Companions you can get a lot more free weapons and armor from Jorrvaskr, including powerful two-handed weapons. When "testing your arm" against Vilkas you can get some free one-handed experience bashing his shield. WARNING: In some rare instances he will kill you, usually for casting mage armor and using magic. If not - you can use the dummies at Jorrvaskr to train a few hours for safe experience. again after joining - strip the place of anything not nailed down(, take all silver plates, goblets, bowls and decanters from the main hall and what you can from downstairs).

Deliver frost salts to Arcadia, then use her alchemy table to begin crafting potions with the herbs you gathered on the way from Helgan. Sell them to her one at a time, along with any ale, wine and mead that you picked up from Dragonreach. Buy training with the surplus money. Maintain a surplus of 3000 septims for wagon rides to other cities. Stop next door at Belethor and sell all the Glazed items you looted from dragon reach - these can't be broken down.

Check the missive's board for each delivery quests to other major cities along with hunt the vampire quests - you should check this board every time you enter a city. You don't have to hunt the vampire, the guards will take care of them. Delivery quests have a time limit, so make sure to only pick up ones you are going to visit in the next few days.

If your speechcraft is high enough (>25) you can talk to Mikael for Carlotta, complete the quest and then loot her shop of garlic and vegetables.

Pick all locked doors while in sneak mode. Even if you're not a thief, you'll get lockpicking experience. Do this everywhere in Skyrim.

Shopping list before leaving Whiterun:- Backpack, Iron lantern, Tent and a set of harvesting knifes (orcish/elven) for skinning / harvesting dead animals - the harvesting knives should be purchased if the general store or blacksmith has stock - if not ask the blacksmith to craft them for you, the rest you can craft yourself.

If you're feeling brave, head north from Whiterun and collect Four treasure chests;

Continue to Lorius' farm and convince him to help Cicero for free speech experience.

If you're feeling like easy combat, head northwest to a mammoth graveyard (location below)  and lure the 2 poachers to the Whiterun guard by Cicero's wagon. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26418143/162266992-a2dca0e2-8d89-4034-b398-400284741da7.png)

Loot their corpses. If you didn't take the mammoth tusk from the Jarl's storeroom - this is your easy change to get one, harvest the dead mammoth and all of the mammoth skulls (your wooden chest will be useful here, otherwise this may take several trips to take everything and run back to Whiterun to sell it). If it gets Dark - place your tent and a campfire and get some camping experience. Check the skills menu on your campfire - you may have perks to invest.

If you meet any slow moving deadly enemies like large mudcrabs or trolls, lure them to Whiterun guards and let them take care of them. Harvest the dead animals.

If you have collected Unusual gems and don't intend on joining the thieves guild - the Khajiit caravans will purchase them from you.

Once you have cleared Whiterun area, get in the wagon and drive to Riften.

The next step sends you to Markarth.

There's also an Archery book(The Marksmanship Lesson) on a table at Mixwater Mill, southwest of Windhelm, in Gilfre's house, which you can get with minimal risk. Alternately, one is inside an expert locked display case in Aela's room in Jorrvaskr's private quarters in Whiterun. Theres a Light Armor book (Rislav The Righteous) in the riverside shack guarded by a wolf or a bear - these can be picked off at range from opposite side of river.

Do the necromancer amulet quest. It's extremely easy and provides an overpowered item (or a lot of gold). Quickest way to safely trigger is to run between windhelm stables and the farm a bit further down the road and back 3 times, then wait until after 7pm before entering the city - Susanna's body should be in the graveyard to start the quest.

**Other easy quests**

Stands-In-Shallows 	 - Windhelm docks - "Some Light Theft" Steal Skooma from the cornerclub - rewards sneak skill.

Torbjorn Shatter-Shield  - House of Clan Shatter-Shield - "Rare Gifts" give him the amulet of Arkay you got from Markarth. (do this before "A Few Words with You").

Scouts-Many-Marshes      - Windhelm docks - "A Few Words with You"  persuade Torbjorn Shatter-Shield to increase wages. Rewards potions.

<details>
  <summary>Revyn Sadri 	        - Sadri's Used Wares -	"That Was Always There" break into a house and plant a ring. (expand to see rewards) </summary>

Option 1: Return the Ring - difficult leveled lock (Expert or Master level). Alternatively, you can opt to pickpocket the key from Viola. Reward: Revyn's disposition towards you will increase. The most immediate implication is that you will be able to freely take all low-cost items in the store and sleep in his bed for free. You will also be able to buy training in Speech to level 50. He is the only Speech trainer that you can trade with (which you can do to get the gold back) without joining the Volkihar vampires.

Option 2: Tell Viola - Reward: Gold, Her disposition towards you will increase, one implication being that you can freely take all low-cost items in her house. This is also the only way to be able to marry her. On the other hand, Revyn's disposition will decrease. This will result in negative comments every time you enter his store, but he will still trade with you (and his other dialogue will be as friendly as otherwise).

Visit the docks talk to Gjalund, ask him to take you to Solstheim.

Read the Book:
* > * A Heavy Armor book (Hallgerd's Tale) in Alor House in Raven Rock in the basement on a shelf (another copy is in Jorrvaskr in Whiterun) 

Quests:-
* Take the Ancient Nordic mining pick quest from Glover mallory (Blacksmith), go to Crescius Caerellius. He will Offer a quest to go deeper into the mine.

* Geldis Sadri in The Retching Netch - It's All In The Taste - Simple delivery quest in Ravens rock
* Captain Veleth - Recipe for Distraction 


If you hug the shore West of town you can pick up bonemeld helment and gloves from the boats (Green Dot), 4 Nirnroot (red marks) and a chest containing Skooma (blue mark).  Don't forget to search every Clam/Pearl Oyster along the way as the amount of pearls, small pearls that can be found adds up. If you swim to the island offshore (yellow Circle) there are dead soliders, but also some ash hoppers guarding them if you are fast you can grab the gear and run. When traveling West do not go past the "herd" of Netch (black Line) Else you will agro the bandits at the tower.

There is a 5th Nirnroot on a Island out to the sea to the north - only attempt this if you have snowberry extract to survive the swim.

Go through the main gate to the South you can follow the shore to pick up more perl Oysters and Clams.If you are brave and quick you can go out the Old Attius Farm where Captain Veleth is fighting the three Ash Spawn, besides him is a dead soldier (red cross) with a full set of high end Bonemold HA armor and usually some high end Elven weapons: Crossbow, Bolts, Sword, Dagger. These initial three Ash Spawn are not as fast as regualr ashspawn and can easily be kited around without getting too close, they also do not seem to have the ranged attack that the other Ash Spawn have. A few silver Crossbow bolts from range will put these down fairly easy. For a little risk you can get a full set of HA and some decent weapons.   When traveling when traveling South outside the gates do not get too close (Blue Line) to the shipwreck as you will agro the Bandits.

You can go past the Raven Rock Mine to the North and pick up at least five Ashen Creeper (first cross). You can cliff climb (second image at fallen treestump looking west) to a Gold Vein and emerald geode to the west (Second cross).  Just North of the first group of Ashen Creeper is two Gold Veins and a dead miner (with pick) with five Gold Ore and a couple of Geode rocks (Third cross). Mine all of these for Gold Ore and Emeralds. Just North of there is an abandoned house (4th cross) and along the East side is a Satchel, but be careful as there is a loaded Bear Trap (3rd image).

## Unverified Info

There's a ton (250+) of Hanging Moss in the Hall of the Dead in Solitude, protected only by two weak skeletons and an apprentice lock.

Narzulbur - East of Kynesgrive has a load of ebony you can mine for free.


## Powerlevelling magic - the cheesetastic way.

Make sure you start "research" from your spell research journal whenever you are "training" for bonus XP.

** Always use your trainers every time you level **

For Destruction and restoration no fighting required, just jump in a forge and heal the fire effect. The fire damage from forge give destruction xp and you heal yourself to earn restoration.

For Restoration, Heal yourself using Heal Self I. Yes, first one, not rank II or higher, use the first one; also, use Turn Undead when possible, and specially Repel Undead when you face more than one enemy. 

for Alteration - use Detect Life in a crowded area. Keep Transmute Muscles, mage armor and mage coat active if you have the spells.

For Conjuration - See a critter?  Soultrap and kill it. Bunnies, foxes, baby spiders, tiny mudcrabs are all none hostile and can be soultrapped for XP. Raise dead on anything you kill.

For Illusion - go to a Inn and cast Lionheart on people. the higher the level the more XP you get. Keep Darkvision up. those critters you are soul trapping for conjouration, use you illusion spells on those too.

The College of Winterhold is a great place to train because of two things:

1. The Arcanium has a feature that allows you to “study” for a few hours which gives you a passive buff that doubles all XP gained (for 12 in game hours or so) for whatever subject you studied
1. There’s a training area downstairs (beneath the Eye of Magnus) where you can be damaged from magical attacks from a Simulated NPC. You can train restoration from there. I also use that area to conjure a summon and attack it with destruction magic. This will level all three schools as your summon will engage in combat and you’ll be damaging an NPC. But As its a training area - you cant be killed, you will simply be K/O and wake up in a bed.


At higher levels

Destruction: Trolls. Specifically frost spells getting cast on frost trolls from a safe height. Destruction becomes stupidly difficult to level with fire and lightning as many things just die instantly. So instead of killing thousands of bandits, find a bunch of trolls. Each tick of Icestorm (level 50 Adept spell) generates XP and there's several ticks per cast per troll. 

Conjuration - make sure you always have a bound weapon summoned.

Illusion: Trolls again. Cast Enraging Orb and watch them fight each other and heal from the damage.  At higher level, cast Fog of Shadow in areas with many high level enemies, like Falmer. They hear the noise of the spell impact and will investigate the area, becoming influenced again and again. To stay out of combat, cast Shadow Stride on yourself.
